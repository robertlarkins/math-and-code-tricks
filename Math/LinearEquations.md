# Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation for a straight line, and can be expressed in a variety of forms.
However, they can all be rearranged into the slope-intercept form.

**Slope-Intercept Form**

`y = mx + c`

`y` the vertical value of the point on the line for a given `x` value
`x` the horizontal value of the point on the line
`m` is the slope or gradient
`c` is a constant for the y-intercept


**Point-Slope Form**

<code>y - y<sub>1</sub> = m(x - x<sub>1</sub>)</code>

where <code>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</code> is a point on the line.


**General Form**

`Ax + By + C = 0`

`A` and `B` cannot both be 0.


**As a Function**

`f(x) = some equation`

In this form `f(x)` is equivalent to `y`.

The Identity Function is `f(x) = x` and has a slope of 1 (45&deg; line).

The Constant Function is `f(x) = C` and is a horizontal line.


## Calculating the Slope

The slope of a line can be calculated from two points on a line.
If these two points are <code>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</code> and <code>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</code>
then the slope (or gradient) `m` is given as

<code>m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)</code>


## Calculating the Constant `c`

The constant in the linear equation is the `y` value when `x = 0`.
Therefore, if both a point <code>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</code> is on the line and the slope `m` is known,
then `c` can be given by rearranging the point-slope form into

<code>c = y<sub>1</sub> - mx<sub>1</sub></code>

knowing that `y = c` when `x = 0`.


## Vertical Line

When the line is vertical, then `x` can only have one value and is effectively constant, while `y` can be any value.
The slope is undefined as it will have a divisor of 0.
