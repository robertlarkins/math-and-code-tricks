# Closed-form Equation Derivation

If a mathematical problem can be directly solved using an equation, then this equation is a closed-form solution of the mathematical problem.
That is, it can solve the given problem in terms of functions and mathematical operations.
Eg: sum of values from 1 to `n` has the closed-form solution `n(n+1)/2`.

**Terminology**
The term _general formula_ or _general solution_ might also be used for this.
